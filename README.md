# Arduino-smartwatch
This file contains source code modifications for the smartwatch made by Godstale. Some changes I made are adding a buzzer to the watch. Currently, all the buzzer does is it beeps whenever I use the button. You can also find the original code here: https://github.com/godstale/retrowatch.
